### Instructions:

1. Add your features/fixes to the "Pending Features/Fixes" section
2. As work begins on an item, it will be moved to "Ongoing Implementation" with 🔄

3. If you're unable to complete a task, add it to an incomplete section with appropriate emoji, so I'd provide further context on it.
4. Feel free to add context or clarification for any feature as needed
